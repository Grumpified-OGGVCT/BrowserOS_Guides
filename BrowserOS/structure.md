# BrowserOS Workflows

## Research Brief

**RESEARCH BRIEF:**

Conduct exhaustive multi‑source research on BrowserOS Workflows to build the definitive technical knowledge base.

**Research Targets:**

- Official BrowserOS documentation (docs, API references, changelogs)
- BrowserOS GitHub repositories (source code, issues, PRs, examples, READMEs)
- Community discussions and implementation examples

**Information to Extract:**

- Core Workflow Architecture - How workflows are structured, defined, and executed
- Step Types & Capabilities - All available step types and their configurations
- Programmatic Integration - Can workflows include code/script execution? Where in the flow (pre/mid/post/conditional)? What languages/runtimes supported?
- Local Workspace Integration - Can workflows access/interact with local workspaces? Read/write capabilities? File system operations?
- Execution Flow Control - Branching, looping, parallel execution, error handling, retries, timeouts
- Trigger Mechanisms - How workflows are initiated (manual, scheduled, event‑driven, API)
- Data Passing - Variable scope, state management, input/output handling between steps
- Advanced Features - Any enterprise/power‑user capabilities (secrets management, conditional logic, sub‑workflows, etc.)
- Configuration Format - YAML/JSON schema, validation rules, IDE support
- Limitations & Constraints - Resource limits, timeout policies, sandbox restrictions

## Deliverable

A comprehensive, structured knowledge base enabling advanced workflow creation with practical examples.

## Knowledge Base

- [BrowserOS_Workflows_KnowledgeBase.md](Research/BrowserOS_Workflows_KnowledgeBase.md) – definitive technical reference covering architecture, step types, programmatic integration, workspace interaction, flow control, triggers, data handling, advanced features, schema, limitations, and usage patterns.
