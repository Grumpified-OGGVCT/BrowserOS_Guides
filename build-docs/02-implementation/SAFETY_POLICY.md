# BrowserOS Workflow Generator - Safety Policy

## Overview

The BrowserOS Workflow Generator includes safety filters designed to prevent the creation of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) or illegal content through the **public hosted interface**. This document explains our approach to safety, user freedom, and responsible use.

---

## 🌐 Public vs Private Instances

### Public Hosted Generator
The workflow generator accessible through our public website (docs/index.html) includes:
- ✅ Automated safety filtering for NSFW content
- ✅ Keyword detection for illegal activities
- ✅ Privacy violation prevention
- ✅ Terms of Service compliance checks
- ✅ Rate limiting and monitoring

**Why?** Public services have a responsibility to prevent misuse, comply with laws, and maintain community standards.

### Private Instances
Users who clone this repository and run their own instance have full control:
- 🔓 Can modify or disable safety filters (`scripts/workflow_generator.py`)
- 🔓 Can customize keyword lists for their jurisdiction
- 🔓 Can create workflows for legitimate use cases that may be filtered publicly
- 🔓 Full autonomy over their deployment

**Why?** We respect user freedom and acknowledge that legitimate use cases vary by context, industry, and jurisdiction.

## 🛡️ Safety Filters Explained

### What Gets Filtered (Public Generator)

The public generator rejects workflow requests containing:

1. **NSFW Content**
   - Adult/explicit material
   - Sexual services or dating app exploitation
   - Anything inappropriate for workplace environments

2. **Illegal Activities**
   - Hacking, cracking, or exploiting systems
   - Credential stuffing or brute force attacks
   - Fraud, identity theft, or financial crimes
   - Copyright infringement or DRM bypass
   - Academic dishonesty (exam cheating, plagiarism)

3. **Privacy Violations**
   - Scraping personal data without consent
   - Surveillance or stalking capabilities
   - Unauthorized location tracking
   - Email/phone harvesting for spam

4. **Terms of Service Violations**
   - Automated account creation
   - Fake engagement or review manipulation
   - Bypassing paywalls without authorization
   - Spam or bot creation

### What's Allowed

✅ Competitive intelligence from public data  
✅ Personal productivity automation  
✅ Testing your own websites/applications

## 🔧 Customizing for Private Use

If you're running your own instance and need to modify safety filters:

### 1. Edit Safety Keywords
```python
# scripts/workflow_generator.py

class KimiWorkflowGenerator:
    # Customize these lists for your use case
    NSFW_KEYWORDS = [...]
    ILLEGAL_KEYWORDS = [...]
    PRIVACY_KEYWORDS = [...]
```

### 2. Disable Safety Checks (Advanced)
```python
def check_safety(self, use_case: str, industry: Optional[str] = None):
    # For private instances, always return safe
    return {'safe': True}
```

### 3. Environment Variable
```bash
# Set this to disable public safety filters
export BROWSEROS_DISABLE_SAFETY_FILTERS=true
```

**IMPORTANT:** If you disable safety filters, you assume full legal responsibility for workflows generated. Ensure your use complies with:
- Local, state, and federal laws
- Website Terms of Service
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Ethical guidelines for your industry

## 📋 Disclaimer for Generated Workflows

All generated workflows include this disclaimer:

```
⚠️ GENERATED WORKFLOW DISCLAIMER

This workflow was generated by AI and should be reviewed before use:
1. Verify it complies with target website's Terms of Service
2. Ensure it respects robots.txt and rate limits
3. Confirm it doesn't violate privacy laws in your jurisdiction
4. Test in a safe environment before production use

Users are solely responsible for how they use generated workflows.
```

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

### Our Position
- **We provide tools**, not instructions for misuse
- **Users are responsible** for their own actions
- **Public generators have guardrails** for community safety
- **Private instances offer flexibility** for legitimate needs

### Your Responsibility
When using BrowserOS Workflow Generator (public or private):
- ✅ Comply with all applicable laws
- ✅ Respect website Terms of Service
- ✅ Follow ethical web scraping practices
- ✅ Obtain consent for personal data collection
- ✅ Honor robots.txt and rate limits
- ✅ Use workflows responsibly

### Gray Areas
Some use cases may be legal in some contexts but not others:
- **Web scraping**: Legal for public data in many jurisdictions, but respect ToS
- **Competitor monitoring**: Generally legal if using public data ethically
- **Automation**: Check if target site allows automated access
- **Data extraction**: Ensure you have rights to the data you're collecting

**When in doubt**: Consult legal counsel familiar with your jurisdiction and use case.

## 💡 Philosophy

We believe in:
- **User freedom** and the right to use tools as you see fit
- **Responsibility** that comes with powerful automation
- **Community safety** in shared public spaces
- **Transparency** about our policies and approach

Browser automation is a powerful capability that can be used for tremendous good—or potential harm. Our safety filters are a reasonable middle ground: protective on public platforms, customizable for private use.
