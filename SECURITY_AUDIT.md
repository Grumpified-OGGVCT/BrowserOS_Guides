# Security Audit Report

## Overview

Security review of the BrowserOS_Guides knowledge base system covering API key handling, input validation, content security, and deployment practices.

## Findings Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| API Key Storage | ✅ Secure | Keys stored in `.env`, excluded via `.gitignore` |
| Content Security Policy | ✅ Configured | CSP headers set in `docs/index.html` |
| Input Sanitization | ✅ Implemented | Client-side sanitization in `app.js` |
| Rate Limiting | ✅ Implemented | Per-IP rate limiting in `mcp-server.js` |
| CORS | ⚠️ Permissive | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on MCP server |
| Dependency Pinning | ✅ Pinned | `requirements.txt` uses version constraints |
| Docker Security | ✅ Non-root user | Production container runs as `kbuser` |

## Recommendations

1. **Restrict CORS** in production to specific allowed origins
2. **Rotate API keys** periodically and after any suspected exposure
3. **Enable HTTPS** for the MCP server in production deployments
4. **Review** content generated by AI pipelines before publishing

## Secret Management

- Store secrets in `.env` (local) or repository secrets (GitHub Actions)
- Never commit `.env` files — verified excluded in `.gitignore`
- Consider HashiCorp Vault or Azure Key Vault for production environments
