# BrowserOS Workflow Library - Executable Artifacts

This directory contains **executable workflow definitions** that can be directly imported and executed by the BrowserOS agent. These are the machine-readable counterparts to the human-readable documentation in the Knowledge Base.

## Directory Structure

```
library/
├── templates/          # Base workflow templates (JSON)
├── schemas/           # JSON Schema definitions for validation
└── README.md          # This file
```

## What's Different from BrowserOS/Workflows/?

The `BrowserOS/Workflows/` directory contains **complete, ready-to-use workflows** with full configurations.

The `library/templates/` directory contains **base templates** extracted from the knowledge base that represent the fundamental patterns and structures documented in our research.

## Usage

These artifacts are designed to be consumed by:
1. **BrowserOS Agent** - Direct execution via `executeGraph()`
2. **MCP Tools** - Self-Knowledge Tool for agent introspection
3. **IDE Integrations** - Code completion and validation
4. **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated workflow testing

## Validation

All workflow definitions in this directory are validated against the BrowserOS GraphDefinition schema. See `schemas/` for validation rules.

## Generation

These artifacts are auto-generated by the `research_pipeline.py` script during knowledge base updates. They extract structured workflow patterns from:
- Official BrowserOS documentation
- Community contributions
- Validated code examples
- GitHub repository analysis
